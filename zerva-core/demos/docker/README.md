# Zerva for Docker

Develop your Zerva project as usual. When done fire up the Docker container like this:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

You can also just build the Docker image like this:

```sh
docker build -t zerva .
```

To fine tune adjust `Dockerfile` and/or `docker-compose.yml`. Learn more about them at [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com).
