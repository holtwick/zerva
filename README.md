# ðŸŒ± Zerva

**Minimal event driven web service infrastructure.**

## Get started

Set up your first project using this [template](https://github.com/holtwick/zerva-project-template/generate).

## How it works

It all starts with the `context` which is the common ground for any **module** we use or create. It serves as a hub/bus for emitting and listening on **events**.

Usually you would start to build a server like this:

```ts
import { useHttp } from "@zerva/http"

useHttp(
  port: 8080
})

```

`serve` itself is a **module** that i.e. it is a function working on **context**. It takes a function to call other modules and provides a common lifecycle by emitting `serveInit` and `serveStart`. These are the entry points for other services.

`useHttp` for example will set up an [express]() server and start it on `serveStart`. It will emit `httpInit` before it starts and `httpRunning` when it is ready.

> By convention, we add `use` to module initializer to be able to identify them at first glance.

You can write your own module which can use `httpInit` to add some listeners:

```ts
function useCounter() {
  let counter = 0
  on('httpInit', ({ get }) => {
    get('/counter', () => `Counter ${counter++}`)
  })
}
```

As you can see a **module** is just a function connecting itself to the **context**. But where is the context? Well `context` is set globally. Similarly, as for Vue and React our helper routines like `on` or `emit` make use of it. This is a great simplification while still being a robust approach.

> If you want to use multiple **contexts** just wrap the code using it into `withContext(context, () => { /* your code */ })`.

On `httpInit` we make use of the http-modules specific `get` helper to answer to http-requests on `/counter`.

To make sure the `http` module is around as well in our context, it is good practice to register oneself and tell about dependencies using `register`:

```ts
function useCounter() {
  register('counter', ['http'])
  let counter = 1
  on('httpInit', ({ get }) => {
    get(
      '/',
      () => `Counter ${counter++}.<br><br>Reload page to increase counter.`
    )
  })
  return {
    getCounter: () => counter,
  }
}
```

As you can see we can also return some custom data or functions from our module, like `getCounter` in our case.

That's basically it!

## Command line convenience

For convenience, you can use the `zerva` command line tool. It is based on [estrella](https://github.com/rsms/estrella) and translates your Typescript code on the fly without further configuration. It also watches for changes and restarts the server immediately. To build add `build` as first argument. The last argument can point to the entry file (Javascript or Typescript), otherwise `src/main.ts` will be used.

In your `package.json` you might want to add these lines:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "zerva",
  "build": "zerva build",
  "serve": "node dist/main.cjs"
},
```

## Docker

Zerva integrates perfectly with Docker. Learn more at [demos/docker](https://github.com/holtwick/zerva/demos/docker).

## Advanced Topics

### Conditional building

Zerva uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) to create both the development server code and the production code. You can take advantage of conditional building using [defines](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define). This can be used to have code that avoids certain imports or otherwise unneed stuff in production mode. I.e. in your code you can do stuff like this:

```ts
if (ZERVA_DEVELEPMENT) {
  /* do something */
}
```

Valid defines are:

- `ZERVA_DEVELOPMENT` is `true` when started as `zerva`
- `ZERVA_PRODUCTION` is `true` when started as `zerva build`

For better compatibility the defines can also be accessed as `process.env.ZERVA_DEVELOPMENT` and `process.env.ZERVA_PRODUCTION`.

## Minimal Requirements

- Node: 16
- JS target: es2022

See [tsconfig/bases](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases) to learn details about the configuration considerations.
